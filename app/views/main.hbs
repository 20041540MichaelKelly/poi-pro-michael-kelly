            <p>An island itself, Ireland is surrounded by smaller islands and islets. Some of these, like the Aran Islands and Skellig Island, are quite well known internationally. And although others, such as Inishbiggle and Gola Island, may be a little less familiar, that doesn't make them any less interesting.
